# An Examination of Food Insecurity and Food Deserts in the United States
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the issue of food access in the US. Current literature is reviewed and used to inform the methods used in our analysis. The main source of data on this subject is taken from the Food Access Research Atlas, provided by the USDA, with supplemental sources on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) also taken from government sources. This data is cleaned and prepared, then explored through machine learning models such as random forest and logistic regression models, mapping with GeoPandas, statistical testing, and visualizations.
